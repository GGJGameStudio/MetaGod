# MetaGod
The sources for the client and the server of the MetaGod game developed during the GGJ 2015 at Rennes.

## Client
The client is developed in pure Javascript, based on NodeJS and NodeWebkit.

## Server
The server is developed in Typescript thanks to Visual Studio 2013 Community (http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) and the Node.js Tools for Visual Studio (http://nodejstools.codeplex.com/).

## Net code
The net code is accomplished thanks to the SocketIO module

# How to use

## Client side
You can find some binaires in the binaries folder. Just get and run them. Then enjoy.

Otherwise, you can retrieve the sources and use NodeJS to run the client.

## Server Side
For the moment, no binaries are available for the server. You have to run the sources to get it working.

You can run the server by typing the next command in a shell:
```bash
node app.js
